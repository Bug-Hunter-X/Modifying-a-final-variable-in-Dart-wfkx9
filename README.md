# Modifying a final variable in Dart
This example demonstrates the error that occurs when trying to modify a `final` variable in Dart after object creation.  `final` variables must be initialized when declared, and their values cannot change after that.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.dart` demonstrates the correct way to handle such situations.
